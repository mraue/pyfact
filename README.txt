============
INTRODUCTION

PyFACT is a collection of python tools for the analysis of Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) data in FITS format. For the
moment it is developed and maintained by Martin Raue (martin.raue@googlemail.com).

============
REQUIREMENTS

The module is written for Python 2.6 and requires the following python packages to be installed:

* numpy 1.5.1 (1.6.0 is currently producing a memory leak together
  with pyfits)
  http://numpy.scipy.org/

* scipy 0.9.0
  http://www.scipy.org/

* pyfits 3.0.0
  http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits/

The data needs to be in CTA FITS format v1.0.0 or higher.

Optional, for plotting:

* matplotlib 1.0.1
  http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

============
INSTALLATION

No installation of the package is required. Simply untar the archive and you are good to go.

=====
USAGE

------
BASICS

Tasks are performed using the python scripts located in the pyfact-vX.X.X/scripts folder. The scripts are excecutable python scripts. To execute them simply type something like:

./scripts/pfmap.py

If you prefer to run them with a specific python version, you can also execute them as normal python scripts, e.g.

python2.6 ./scripts/pfmap.py

They can also run inside an interactive session, e.g. in ipython

In [0]: %run ./scripts/pfmap.py

The scripts come with a builtin help text, which is displayed when the scripts are called without any argument or with the -h/--help option:

./scripts/pfmap.py
./scripts/pfmap.py -h
./scripts/pfmap.py --help
